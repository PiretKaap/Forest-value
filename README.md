# Introduction
This project serves as the final submission for the **ValiIT! Data Analyst** course. The primary goal was to develop a data-driven tool for **Timber AS** that accurately assesses the value of forest and agricultural land. The project demonstrates our ability to apply core data analysis principles—including data cleaning, analysis, and visualization—to solve a complex, real-world business challenge.
