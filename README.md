# Research Problem:  
To assess the value of forest and agricultural land.
# Goal:
To develop a data-driven tool for **Timber AS** that accurately assesses the value of forest and agricultural land. 

# Project Objective
The core objective was to create a robust and comprehensive valuation tool. Our a model that integrates multiple critical factors to provide a data-supported estimate of a property's worth. 

**Key variables considered in the analysis include:**

* Timber Harvest Costs: The financial outlay for felling, processing, and transporting mature timber.

* Value of Immature Timber: The projected future value of non-harvestable, growing forest assets.

* Regional Land Prices: Local market data for comparable properties to establish a baseline value.

* Accessibility: The presence and quality of access roads, which directly impact logistics and operational costs.

* Conservation Restrictions: Any environmental or legal limitations that may affect land use and financial value.

The final output is a detailed income and expense table, which provides a clear, summarized valuation for either the entire property or a specific portion, such as the growing forest.
