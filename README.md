# Introduction
This is the final project for the **ValiIT! Data Analyst** course. The project demonstrates our ability to apply core data analysis principles—including **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization**—to solve a complex, real-world business challenge.
### Technical Tools Used:
*Data Manipulation & Analysis:* **Python (Pandas, NumPy), Jupiter Notebook**

*Data Visualization:* **Python (ipywidgets)**

*Data source formats:* **JSON, API, Excel**

*Version Control:* **GitHub**

# Research Problem:  
Timber AS operates in the fields of forestry, real estate, and the wood industry. It uses an in-house, depreciated program to calculate the values of forest land. The company wants a basecode to make the valuation process smoother and more efficient. 

# Research Plan 
The main question is how to determine a forests lands true value.   
For this, we will:

# Business Glossary
Our solution will return tables which are generated by a Python script that processes cadastral data from a API source. 
It provides wood usage by volume and price, and an estimated value of the cadastral area.

# How to use the Python code
To get the Pyhton code working you need the following files:

**Pythoni base code** - Forest_UI_API.ipynb <br />
**Base datasets** - Mahutabel.xlsx , Puu_nimetused_EE_ENG.xlsx , Suhtelised_tugikõrgused.xlsx <br />
**Uploadable dataset** - Hinnakiri.xlsx

When you've downloaded the files, open **Forest_UI_API.ipynb** via Visual Studio Code.
1. Connect the base datasets to the code.
2. **Run** the code.
3. Go to the code answer and fill in the fields. (For the price list, you can also upload **Hinnakiri.xlsx** to get the prices.)
4. **Fill in** the API section.
5. Choose how much info about the cadastral unit you'd like to see.
6. Press **"Arvuta."**
7. See the data.

# Description of Data Protection
The project does not process personal data.
The data in the capacity table has been modified to protect the trade secrets of Timber AS.

The fundamental principles, governing the processing of data in the project, are as follows:
1. Legality – the data provided by Timber AS are being processed;
2. Purpose limitation – the data shall be used solely for the calculation of the value of forest;
3. Data minimalisation – only the minimum amount of data necessary to achieve the objective shall be processed;
4. Retention period – the period of data retention shall be determined by Timber AS;
5. Security – the data will not be shared with third parties and will be kept safe.


# Data Quality Control 
Data Quality Control (DQC) in a data analysis project involves systematically applying methods to ensure data meets predefined quality standards before, during, and after analysis.
Key steps include:
1. Defining Quality Standards. The necessary data for analysis is verified for completeness, ensuring no missing fields and compliance with the required format.
2. Data Input Control. If incorrect data is entered or the wrong file is uploaded, the program will stop working and an error message will be displayed.
3. Data Transformation. Using a Python program, trees are classified into groups based on their diameters. The trees diameter range for calculations is 5–52 cm.
4. Continuous Monitoring. Any errors or deviations in the provided data trigger immediate notifications by the program.

# Future for the base code :rocket:
