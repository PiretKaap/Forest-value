# Introduction
This is the final project for the **ValiIT! Data Analyst** course. The project demonstrates our ability to apply core data analysis principles—including **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization**—to solve a complex, real-world business challenge.
### Technical Tools Used:
*Data Manipulation & Analysis:* **Python (Pandas, NumPy)**

*Data Visualization:* **Python (ipywidgets)**

*Data source formats:* **JSON, API, Excel**

*Version Control:* **GitHub**

# Research Problem:  
Company X operates in the fields of forestry, real estate, and the wood industry. It uses an in-house, depreciated program to calculate the values of forest land. The company wants a basecode to make the valuation process smoother and more efficient. 

# Research Plan 
The main question is how to determine a forests lands true value. 
For this, we will: 

1. Understand the calculations of the program in use. XML (for structure/configuration) and EXCEL (for data tables and formulas). 
2. Isolate and record the fixed values, constants, or unchanging initial parameters that remain constant across all calculations or scenarios.  EXCEL 
3. Define the changeable (variable) initial data. EXCEL (for data organization) + Py (Python for identification and dynamic handling). 
OUR SOLUTION Create a base code that utilizes the cadastral data generated by Linda AI. API (data origin from) + JSON (data format) + PY (Python programming language) + JUPITER NOTEBOOK (interactive environment for development and documentation).

# Business Glossary
Returns tables which are generated by a Python script that processes cadastral data from a JSON or API source. 
It provides three key outputs: a detailed table of cadastral data, wood usage by volume and price, and an estimated value of the cadastral area.

# Description of Data Protection
The fundamental principles governing the processing of data provided by Company X for the purposes of the final project are as follows:
1. Legality – the processing of data is based on the mandate of Company X;
2. Purpose limitation – the data shall be used solely for the calculation of the value of forest land;
3. Data minimalisation – only the minimum amount of data necessary to achieve the objective shall be processed;
4. Accuracy and data quality – the data used shall be those deemed necessary by the client for the fulfilment of the task;
5. Retention period – the period of data retention shall be determined by the company X;
6. Security – the data shall not be disclosed to any third party, and their preservation shall be duly ensured;
7. Accountability and transparency – where necessary, the company X shall be provided with information regarding the manner in which the data are processed and utilised for the achievement of the final projec’s objective. Reliability, confidentiality, and the protection of the company X’s trade secrets shall be observed at all times.

# Data Quality Control 
Data Quality Control (DQC) in a data analysis project involves systematically applying methods to ensure data meets predefined quality standards before, during, and after analysis.
Key steps include:
1. Defining Quality Standards. The necessary data for analysis (e.g., forest stand allocations XML file, Linda AI .json file, relative support height data, tree species data, and volume and price data for wood types like logs, small timber, pulpwood, and fuelwood) is verified for completeness, ensuring no missing fields and compliance with the required format.
2. Data Input Control. Automated checks during data entry prevent poor-quality data. If the "Price" column contains non-numeric values or negative prices, an error message is displayed. Missing prices are assigned a value of 0.
3. Data Transformation. Using a Python program, trees are classified into groups based on their diameters. If a tree’s diameter is less than 5 cm, an error message is issued; diameters exceeding 52 cm are capped at 52 cm. The diameter range for calculations is 5–52 cm.
4. Continuous Monitoring and Reporting. Any errors or deviations in the provided data trigger immediate notifications by the program.
