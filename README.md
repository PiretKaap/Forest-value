# Research Problem:  
Company X operates in the fields of forestry, real estate, and the wood industry. It uses an in-house, time-consuming program to calculate the values of forest and agricultural land. The company wants a tool to make the valuation process smoother and more efficient.

# Research Plan 
The main question is how to determine a property's true value. For this, we will create a model that calculates a data-supported estimate based on a number of key variables. 

# Business Glossary
Return a valuation software or model used to calculate the value of forest and agricultural land by integrating multiple factors.
